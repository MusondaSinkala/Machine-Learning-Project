SUMMARY

The Random Forest model is configured with the following parameters:

n_estimators: Number of trees in the forest (100 trees in this case).
max_depth: Maximum depth of the trees (None, allowing trees to expand until all leaves are pure).
min_samples_split: Minimum number of samples required to split an internal node (2).
min_samples_leaf: Minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node (1).
Other parameters such as bootstrap, criterion, max_features, and random_state are also set to default values.
Overall, the Random Forest model appears to perform well on the given dataset, achieving high accuracy and demonstrating robustness through cross-validation.
